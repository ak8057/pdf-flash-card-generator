Creativity in Engineering
In engineering we find a constant stream of new problems that need new, effective
(creative) solutions.
Problem: How can we reduce the fuel cost of commercial aircraft?
Solution: Winglets!
■Winglets reduce drag by 5-7%.
■ This reduces fuel consumption by about 4.5%.
This saves a 767 about 4,000 litres of fuel on flight from Sydney to Perth.

Genesis
Winglets also save about 12.5 tonnes of CO2 for a 767 on the same flight.
Therefore save about $287.50 in carbon tax on same flight.
So they solve a problem that probably nobody was thinking of when they were
introduced some years ago - carbon tax reduction!
They also allow aircraft to take off and land using less power, and
therefore with less noise

■Are Winglets a creative solution?
■Are they novel?
         ■While might not "surprise" us now, because we are used to them, when first
introduced, they were undoubtedly a novel way of tackling the problem of reducing your
fuel consumption?
■Are they effective?
         ■They certainly achieve the goal (solve the problem) of reducing fuel consumption.
■That's what engineering is all about.
■Finding novel, effective (i.e. Creative) technological solutions to the needs and problems
faced by society.
■Creativity therefore plays a vital role in engineering.

Innovation in Engineering
■Creativity = effectiveness (the solution must solve the problem) + novelty (it should be
original, surprising) + elegance + genesis.
■Innovation = invention (creativity) + exploitation.
■Innovation is about making productive use of novel, effective solutions.
Innovative Solutions
Effectiveness ensures that solutions actually work.
Novelty ensures that we explore the widest possible range of ideas, that we move
forward, that we maximise our chance of finding the best solution.
Elegance ensures that our solutions are complete, fully worked out, aesthetically
pleasing, safe and sustainable.
Genesis ensures that the solution looks forward, anticipates new problems and opens
up new ideas about the problem.

Engineers are constantly designing new ideas and
concepts to overcome problems. No two problems or
issues are the same and for this reason, creativity is
highly sought after in the engineering field. Liu describes
the need for creativity in engineering very well:
“The profession of engineering demands that engineers
recognize, validate, and solve problems on their own
and through team work. More importantly, they should
demonstrate original and critical thinking, and
creativeness and innovativeness in their methodologies.
In short, engineers need a creative mind to meet the
advancing goal of engineering profession - to design
new products or systems and improve existing ones for
the benefit of humankind"
IMPORTANCE OF CREATIVITY IN ENGINEERING

Creativity is one of the most important soft skills for an Engineer. Engineers must always
think of creative ways to come up with a solution, and they need to use their creativity to
envision future innovations. Like any skill, creativity can be trained and improved.
Be open to new ideas to analyse them later: Enginers should never focus only on one
idea or solution. Instead, it is important to free your spirit and stay open to other ideas,
methods, or point of view to be a better innovator. 
See problems as challenges, not difficulties: A good engineer is a problem solver at
heart! To keep a creative mind, try to focus only on the solutions hidden behind the
difficulties you will encounter
Have fun and don’t be afraid to be different: To be a true visionary, you should not be
afraid to take risks and to think differently. Engineers need to learn to trust themselves
with their ideas and to accept being a free spirit.
